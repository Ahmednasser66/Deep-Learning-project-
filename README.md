# Deep-Learning-project-
A Chatbot is a computer program that is designed to simulate conversation with human users, either via text or voice interactions â€“in our project text- chatbots are often used in customer service, marketing, and other applications where automated communication is needed.
There are several ways to build Chabot, but we used a pre-trained model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to implement them in our project.
